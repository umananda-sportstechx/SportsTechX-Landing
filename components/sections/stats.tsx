/**
 * The navy band. On the artboard the section is 1513x308 and the row inside it
 * is 1086x149 laid out as
 *   rule, stat, rule, stat, rule, stat, rule, stat, rule
 * — five zero-width rules with a 50px gap either side, so they land evenly at
 * x = 0, 272, 543, 814, 1086.
 *
 * That structure is reproduced literally here. The previous version put the
 * outer rules on the list's own left/right borders, and because the list
 * stretched to the container the final rule landed at the container edge
 * instead of 50px past the last figure — which is why the last gap was double
 * the others. `w-fit` is what holds the row to its content.
 *
 * Everything is 0.9x the artboard: figure 72 -> 64.8, caption 16 -> 14.4 (both
 * off --scale-stat so the designed 4.5:1 survives), rules 149 -> 134, gap 50 -> 45.
 */
/* Rule height and column gap sit a little above the 0.9x type scale by choice —
 * the band reads better with more air than a strict 0.9 of the artboard's
 * 149/50 gives. The gap is fluid rather than fixed: the row is w-fit, so a flat
 * 56px would make it 1068px wide and overflow the container at the lg
 * breakpoint (1024px, where the column is only ~921px). This tracks from 28px
 * there up to 56px at 1512. */
